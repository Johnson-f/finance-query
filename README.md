**FinanceQuery** is an open-source API for financial data that provides real-time quotes, market data, news, and
technical indicators. It sources data from the unofficial Yahoo Finance API, web scraping, and other financial data
providers.

## Documentation

[Interactive API Documentation](https://financequery.apidocumentation.com/reference)

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Verdenroz/finance-query.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd finance-query
```

Install dependencies

```bash
# Using Poetry (recommended)
poetry install

# Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Cythonize files

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Start the server

```bash
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

## Usage/Examples

The exposed endpoints to the API are:

- https://43pk30s7aj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod
- https://finance-query.onrender.com

An `x-api-key` header can be added if you have enabled security and rate limiting. If a key is not provided, or an
invalid key is used, a rate limit of 2000 requests/day is applied to the request's ip address.

> If you are deploying this for yourself, you can create your own admin key which will not be rate limited. See
> the [.env template](.env.template).

### Example REST Request

```bash
# Get detailed quote for NVIDIA stock
curl -X GET 'https://finance-query.onrender.com/v1/quotes?symbols=nvda' \
  -H 'x-api-key: your-api-key'
```

### Example WebSocket Connection

```javascript
// Connect to WebSocket for real-time updates
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://finance-query.onrender.com/quotes');

ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log('Connected to FinanceQuery WebSocket');
    // Send symbol to subscribe to updates
    ws.send('TSLA');

## Deployment

### AWS Lambda

Perfect for serverless applications with automatic scaling:

- Follow
  the [AWS Lambda Deployment Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-image.html#python-image-instructions)
- Remember to add the environment variables to the Lambda function
- Alternatively use the [AWS Deployment Workflow](.github/workflows/aws-deploy.yml), providing repository secrets for
  `AWS_SECRET_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`.
- Also edit the `AWS_REGION`, `ECR_REPOSITORY`, and `FUNCTION_NAME` in the workflow file

### Render

Easy deployment with WebSocket support:

- Follow the [Render Deployment Guide](https://render.com/docs/deploy-fastapi)
- The deployment should use the `Dockerfile` file in the repository
- Be sure to override the CMD in the Dockerfile in your Render project settings to
  `python -m uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Alternatively use the [Render Deployment Workflow](.github/workflows/render-deploy.yml), providing repository secrets
  for `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`.
- The deploy hook url can be found in the settings of your Render project

### Docker

Deploy anywhere with Docker:

```bash
# Basic deployment
docker build -t financequery .
docker run -p 8000:8000 financequery
```

#### Docker with Custom Logging Configuration

Configure logging at build time:

```bash
# Build with custom logging settings
docker build \
  --build-arg LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  --build-arg LOG_FORMAT=text \
  --build-arg PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD_MS=1000 \
  -t financequery .
```

Or configure at runtime:

```bash
# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=WARNING \
  -e LOG_FORMAT=json \
  -e PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD_MS=5000 \
  financequery
```

#### Production Docker Example

```bash
# Production deployment with structured logging
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
  -e LOG_FORMAT=json \
  -e PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD_MS=2000 \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379 \
  financequery
```

> **Note**: There are two workflows that will automatically deploy to render and AWS, but they will require repository
> secrets for `AWS_SECRET_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, and `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`. Quite frankly, render is easier to work
> with since it enables the websockets, but will require the paid Starter Plan as this API requires extensive memory. If
> you are tight on cash, consider Lambda.

> **WebSocket Support**: Remember the websockets above are not available through Lambda. If you deploy to Render
> instead, you will be able to connect to the websockets through a request that looks like
`wss://finance-query.onrender.com/...`

## Configuration

Customize FinanceQuery with environment variables. These environment variables are optional. The API will function with
default settings if not provided.

### Security Configuration

```env
USE_SECURITY=true
ADMIN_API_KEY=your-secret-admin-key
```

### Proxy Configuration

```env
USE_PROXY=true
PROXY_URL=your-proxy-url
PROXY_TOKEN=your-proxy-token
```

### Redis Caching

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Algolia Search

```env
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=your-algolia-app-id
ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your-algolia-api-key
```

### Logging Configuration

Control logging behavior for debugging, monitoring, and production deployments:

```env
# Log level - controls verbosity
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

# Log format - structured vs human-readable
LOG_FORMAT=json  # Options: json, text

# Performance monitoring threshold in milliseconds
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD_MS=2000  # Operations taking longer than this trigger warnings
```

#### Log Levels

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, including cache hits/misses and operation details
- **INFO**: General information about requests, responses, and external API calls
- **WARNING**: Performance issues and slow operations
- **ERROR**: Error conditions and failed operations
- **CRITICAL**: System-level failures that require immediate attention

#### Log Formats

- **JSON** (`LOG_FORMAT=json`): Structured logging for production monitoring systems
- **Text** (`LOG_FORMAT=text`): Human-readable format for development and debugging

#### Performance Monitoring

Adjust `PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD_MS` based on your requirements:
- **Development**: `500` - Strict performance monitoring
- **Production**: `2000` - Balanced monitoring (default)
- **High-load**: `5000` - Relaxed monitoring for systems under heavy load
