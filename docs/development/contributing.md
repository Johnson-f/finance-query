## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.11 or newer. We recommend using a virtual environment:

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installation with Poetry (recommended)

Alternatively, you can use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management:

```console
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install --with dev
```

This will install all dependencies defined in the pyproject.toml file, including development dependencies.

To activate the Poetry virtual environment:

```console
$ eval $(poetry env activate)

# Or on Windows:
Invoke-Expression (poetry env activate)
```

### Installation with pip

Install the project dependencies:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development, you'll also need the development dependencies:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

### Setting up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
See the `.env.template` file for an example.

```
# Basic configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Optional, for caching and WebSocket support
USE_SECURITY=True  # Enable rate limiting
BYPASS_CACHE=False  # Set to True to disable caching during development

# Proxy configuration (optional)
USE_PROXY=False
PROXY_URL=
PROXY_TOKEN=
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ pytest
```

You can also run specific test files:

```console
$ pytest tests/test_quotes.py
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

[pytest]: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/

## Local development

To run the application locally:

```console
$ python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

This will start the API server at `http://localhost:8000` with automatic reloading enabled.

You can also use Docker:

```console
$ docker build -t finance-query .
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 finance-query
```

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests for new functionality.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.
- Follow the existing code style (Black formatting, isort imports).

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can use:

```console
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
